                My name is Pukar Bartaula. I am originally from Ratuwamai-8, Damrabhitta, Morang, a beautiful place in eastern Nepal. Currently, I am living in Kathmandu for my Bachelorâ€™s education.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and continuously improving my skills. My hometown has deeply influenced my values, and I carry that sense of community and resilience with me wherever I go.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new ideas, working on creative projects, and connecting with people who share similar interests.
