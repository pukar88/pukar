        <div className="Aboutcontainer">My name is Pukar Bartaula, and I hail from the serene town of Ratuwamai-8, Damrabhitta in Morang, a picturesque area in eastern Nepal known for its rich culture, warmth of the people, and natural beauty. Growing up in such a peaceful and closely-knit community has deeply shaped my character, instilling in me strong values of resilience, humility, and a sense of belonging. These values continue to guide me in all aspects of my personal and academic life.

Currently, I am residing in Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, where I am pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s degree at Texas International College. Living in Kathmandu has opened up a world of opportunities for me, especially in terms of education and exposure to emerging technologies. The dynamic and fast-paced environment of the city contrasts with the calmness of my hometown, but it has helped me grow both academically and personally.

I am passionate about technology and constantly strive to stay updated with the latest developments in the field. I enjoy learning new programming languages, experimenting with software tools, and building creative projects that allow me to apply and enhance my technical knowledge. I strongly believe that continuous learning is the key to growth, and I am committed to improving my skills every day.

In my free time, I like to explore innovative ideas, work on personal projects, and connect with like-minded individuals who are equally enthusiastic about technology and creativity. Whether it's collaborating on a small web development task or discussing the future of AI, I find joy in engaging with new perspectives and challenging myself to think outside the box.

My journey from Damrabhitta to Kathmandu has been one of learning, growth, and transformation. While I embrace the opportunities and challenges of city life, I always carry the spirit and simplicity of my hometown in my heart. I look forward to making meaningful contributions to the tech community and to society at large, driven by the roots that keep me grounded and the dreams that push me forward.
